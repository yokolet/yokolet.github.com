    <p>Recently, I decided to give Clojure a try.
This post is about testing HackerRank problems on a local env.</p>

<p>I used to write Clojure code for my day job, however, no Clojure at all for two years.
Instead, almost all were done by Python.
I became familiar with Python’s functional programming world now.
Aside of ML/DL projects, I did bunch at HackerRank, leetcode or sort.
After a while, I thought, “maybe I can solve problems by Clojure like Python…”</p>

<p>Luckily, HackerRank supports Clojure. So, I started.</p>

<p>Soon, I hit the wall. I wanted to test a code. Okay, writing test is not hard.
Something quite hard was the HackerRank platform.
Test data comes in from <code>STDIN</code>. Something output to <code>STDOUT</code> is tested.
For many problems, it’s effective to have <code>read-line</code> and <code>println</code> in the code side.</p>

<p>I did quite a lot of research and trials so that the code can be tested
without any modification on HackerRank platform.
This experience, setting up a testing environment was a good Clojure study.
That’s why I wrote the blog post.
This post may help other Clojure newbies to figure out how.</p>

<h4 id="binding-stdin">Binding <code>STDIN</code></h4>

<p>Clojure has <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/binding"><code>clojure.core/binding</code></a> function.
This function is used to create new bindings, which is like, replacing the current bindings.
In Clojure, <code>STDIN</code> is bind to <code>*in*</code>.
So, what should be done is to bind <code>*in*</code> to something else.</p>

<p>Next question is what should be “something else.”</p>

<p>HackerRank test case is provided by a file.
People can get the test data file if they pay 5 Hackos.
The “Hackos” are points people can get when their solutions successfully pass all tests.
Unless the problem is a very entry level, the test case file tends to pretty big.
It’s unable to write the test data in the code often.
For this reason, I wanted to get the test data from a file and bind it to <code>*in*</code>.</p>

<p>What I did was:</p>
<ol>
  <li>create a file under <code>resource</code> directory</li>
  <li>read it as a resource</li>
  <li>convert it to a reader</li>
  <li>bind the reader to <code>*in*</code></li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])
(with-open [rdr (io/reader (io/resource n))]
    (binding [*in* rdr]
      (f)))
</code></pre>

<p>Since the project was created by the <a href="https://leiningen.org/"><code>leningen</code></a>,
the <code>resources</code> directory is already on the path. Just to give a relative file path
as <code>n</code>, the file is read. The <code>f</code> is a function which consumes data from <code>STDIN</code>.</p>

<h4 id="catching-stdout">Catching <code>STDOUT</code></h4>

<p>Now, reading from <code>STDIN</code> was cleared. Next will be to catch <code>STDOUT</code>.
Clojure has a convenient function <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/with-out-str"><code>clojure.core/with-out-str</code></a>.
Compared to a reading part, catching <code>STDOU</code> was much easier.
For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">;; define function which prints to stdout
&gt; (defn say-it []
    (println "seriously?")
    (println "can't believe"))

;; assign STDOUT to "out"
&gt; (def out (with-out-str (say-it)))

;; what's in the "out"
&gt; out
"seriously?\ncan't believe\n" 
</code></pre>

<p>The same idea for the reading can be applied to <code>STDOUT</code> – printing out to a file under <code>resources</code> directory.
However, in general, the expected output is simple for the HackerRank problems.
At this moment, <code>with-out-str</code> function satisfies my needs.</p>

<h4 id="wrapping-tests">Wrapping Tests</h4>

<p>So far, <code>STDIN</code> and <code>STDOUT</code> work well to fit with the HackerRank platform.
However, to bind resource reader to <code>STDIN</code>, I should write <code>with-open ...</code> in every test case. 
I want to avoid writing the same lines again and again.
After searching online, I found <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.test/use-fixtures"><code>clojure.test/use-fixtures</code></a> function.
This function works like Unit test’s <code>setUp()/tearDown()</code> methods.
As the Clojure API document explains:</p>

<pre><code class="language-clojure">(defn my-test-fixture [f]
        (create-db)   ;; setUp
        (f)           ;; test
        (destroy-db)) ;; tearDown
(use-fixtures :once my-test-fixture
</code></pre>
<p>Define the fixture function, then call <code>use-fixture</code> function.
The tests in the same namespace are all wrapped by the fixture.</p>

<p>Below is an example test by the <code>use-fixture</code> function.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/yokolet/efad0031c483bcc77ea9ada37e708db2.js"> </script>

<h4 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h4>

<p>The function <code>use-fixture</code> made my test code simple. It’s good.
However, it has a downside.
Some problems provide multiple test cases, which means multiple resource files on my test environment.
Since only one <code>use-fixture</code> is applied to all tests in the same namespace,
my <code>wrap-test</code> and fixture design don’t work nicely.
There should be a way to cope with this problem.
It will be my next challenge.</p>

<p>If you are interested, my solution and test code for <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code">30 Days of Code</a>
are in my repository, <a href="https://github.com/yokolet/thirty-day-code">thirty-day-code</a>.</p>

                <p><p>In the web application domain, we hear some protocol names.
Absolutely, HTTP or HTTPS is the most famous protocol that all web developers know.
Although there’s a mechanism of <a href="/2024/07/17/conserving-network-resources-keep-alive.html">Keep-Alive</a>,
a single request/response sequence with a single client/server is all done by HTTP.
The client initiates the HTTP request to the server. Once the client receives the HTTP response from the server,
communication finishes. As far as HTTP is used, the server just waits and waits. Only when the request comes in, the
server can send back some data to the client. This communication style is surprisingly capable of doing many things,
so most web applications are satisfied with HTTP.</p>
